#  Smart Locker Management System

An **IoT-based Smart Locker Management System** designed to automate secure locker access, monitoring, and management using **cloud services and AI-driven analytics**.  
The system enhances **security, efficiency, and user experience** in shared environments such as **campuses, offices, and public facilities**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Smart Locker Management System integrates **hardware and software components** to provide real-time locker control and monitoring.  
An **ESP32 microcontroller** manages locker operations and communicates with cloud services for instant updates.

Users access lockers using **secure QR-code authentication**, eliminating the need for physical keys and reducing unauthorized access risks.  
Administrators manage lockers and users through a **cloud-based web dashboard** with real-time status tracking.
